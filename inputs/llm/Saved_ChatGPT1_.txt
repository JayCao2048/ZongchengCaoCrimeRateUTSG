Check for grammar mistakes and write more formally: This paper will be dedicated to three types of crimes that were mentioned in the media the most, and widely discussed inside the Chinese community in Ontario. These crimes are assault, robbery, shooting, and homicide.

Moreover, the paper will use the crime rate data rather than crime count, because the population of a specific area is unstable. Within a larger population, the probability of crime concurrency will rise, vice verse. For this reason, using the crime rate to exhibit the alterations of crime over 9 years is in a logically coherent manner, since the population will vary in 9 years.

Since the interest of this research is about safety around the UTSG campus, then among the 158 areas, three areas will be analyzed through this paper. These three geometric places contained the campus itself, and where most UTSG students live, which are named "Bay-Cloverhill", "Church-Wellesley", and "University". Among these three places, "University" is the area where campus is located, and most UTSG students reside in the area "Bay-Cloverhill" and "Church-Wellesley".

ChatGPT:


This paper is dedicated to the analysis of three specific types of crimes that have received extensive media coverage and have been widely discussed within the Chinese community in Ontario. These crimes include assault, robbery, shootings, and homicides.

Furthermore, the paper will utilize crime rate data rather than crime counts due to the unstable population within specific areas. In areas with larger populations, the likelihood of concurrent criminal incidents increases, and conversely decreases in areas with smaller populations. Therefore, employing crime rates to illustrate changes in crime over a span of nine years is a logically coherent approach, given the expected variations in population over this time period.

Considering the primary focus of this research is on the safety in the vicinity of the University of Toronto St. George (UTSG) campus, the paper will specifically analyze three distinct geographic areas among the 158 designated areas. These three areas encompass the campus itself and the locations where a significant number of UTSG students reside, namely "Bay-Cloverhill," "Church-Wellesley," and "University." Among these three areas, "University" is the precise location of the campus, while "Bay-Cloverhill" and "Church-Wellesley" are the residential areas where the majority of UTSG students live.

Same for this part: Figure 1 shows the change in assault rate from 2014 to 2023. There are three lines with distinct colors illustrating three different area names, where red represents "Bay-Cloverhill", green represents "Church-Wellesley", and blue represents "University".

From the figure, it is obvious that in the residential areas, "Church-Wellesley" has a higher assault rate than "Bay-Cloverhill". The reason for this phenomenon to occur is the difference in facilities between these two areas. "Church-Wellesley" holds more facilities like bars, homeless shelters, cannabis shops, etc, which can end up with a higher likelihood of assaults. Compared with "Church-Wellesley" area, buildings in "Bay-Cloverhill" area are mostly residential and commercial, which lowers the probability of assaults.

the assault rate of "University" is higher than the other two residential areas from 2014 to 2019. After 2019, the average assault rate had a sudden drop, followed by an increment that had not surpass the assault rate before 2019. The unexpected drop can be explained by the incident of COVID-19 pandemic. During that special period, most in-person classes are canceled, transforming into online educating mode, which leads to a minimum number of people in campus. When the pandemic gradually fades out, more people start to return to the campus, causing the assault rate to rise again.

Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of the assault rates from 2014 to 2023. The graph consists of three distinct lines, each represented by a different color, corresponding to the three designated areas: "Bay-Cloverhill" in red, "Church-Wellesley" in green, and "University" in blue.

From the graph, it is evident that in the residential areas, "Church-Wellesley" consistently exhibits a higher assault rate compared to "Bay-Cloverhill." This disparity can be attributed to the varying facilities available in these two regions. "Church-Wellesley" boasts a higher number of establishments such as bars, homeless shelters, and cannabis shops, among others, which potentially contributes to a heightened likelihood of assaults. Conversely, "Bay-Cloverhill" is characterized by predominantly residential and commercial buildings, thereby reducing the probability of assault incidents.

Interestingly, the assault rate in the "University" area surpasses that of the other two residential areas from 2014 to 2019. However, after 2019, there is a noticeable abrupt decline in the average assault rate, followed by an increase that does not surpass the assault rate observed prior to 2019. This unexpected drop can be attributed to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this unique period, most in-person classes were suspended, transitioning to online education, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of individuals present on the campus. As the pandemic gradually receded, more people began returning to the campus, leading to a subsequent rise in the assault rate once again.

Same for this part: Figure 2 displays the robbery rate of the three selected areas. The color symbolization is the same as in Figure 1. Robbery is a more serious crime than assault, so comparing Figure 2 with Figure 1, without a doubt, the robbery rate is much lower than the assault rate.

From 2014 to 2019, "University" area has a higher robbery rate than the other two areas unquestionably, which means that the campus has a heightened chance of robbery occurring than the residential area. However, the extremely high robbery rate in 2014 scales down rapidly, even becoming lower than "Church-Wellesley" area after 2018. Similar to Figure 1, the robbery rate experiences a severe drop during the pandemic and starts to rise after 2020. Still, differentiate with the high robbery rate in 2004, around 700, the post-pandemic robbery rate never surpass 200, and even go through a slight drop from 2022 to 2023.
------------------
ChatGPT:


Figure 2 provides an overview of the robbery rates within the three designated areas, maintaining the same color scheme as Figure 1. It is worth noting that robbery is considered a more severe crime than assault; hence, when comparing Figure 2 with Figure 1, it is evident that the robbery rate is significantly lower.

From 2014 to 2019, the "University" area unquestionably exhibited a higher robbery rate than the other two areas, indicating a greater propensity for robberies on the campus compared to the residential areas. However, the exceptionally high robbery rate in 2014 witnessed a swift and substantial decline, eventually falling below the robbery rate of the "Church-Wellesley" area after 2018. Similar to the observations made in Figure 1, the robbery rate experienced a sharp decline during the COVID-19 pandemic and commenced an upward trajectory after 2020. Nevertheless, in contrast to the high robbery rate in 2014, which approached 700, the post-pandemic robbery rate never exceeded 200, and even demonstrated a slight decrease from 2022 to 2023.

Same for this: Figure 3 presents the shooting rate around the selected areas, and Figure 4 shows the homicide rate. These two crimes transpire much less than assault and robbery due to the much more severe outcomes. For that reason, the shooting rates and homicide rates equal to zero for some years, such as there is no shooting in "University" area from 2014 to 2016. Also, no clear pattern can be detected through the line graphs due to the zero inputs, each line is fluctuating in different kinds of amplitudes. Nevertheless, some phenomena can be identified through a comparison of the three different areas, and the overall trend from 2014 to present time.

In Figure 3, it is obvious that the when shootings happen, the shooting rate of "University" area is much higher than the residential areas, and the last shooting in "University" area happened in 2021. However, shootings in the residential area happened more often than on the UTSG campus, but with a lower shooting rate.

In Figure 4, the fluctuation is more random than in Figure 3. The reason for such a situation is that homicides are much more difficult to prevent, and happen at random. For example, shootings can be prevented by regulating requirements for carrying firearms, assaults and robberies can be prevented by increasing police patrols, etc. Unlikely, homicides cannot be prohibited before wards like the other crimes. Still, by Figure 4, it is clear that in the past four years, only minimum homicides happened in the "Church-Wellesley" area, while both "University" and "Bay-Cloverhill" areas maintained zero homicides.
------------------
ChatGPT:


Figure 3 portrays the shooting rates within the selected areas, while Figure 4 illustrates the homicide rates. These two crimes occur significantly less frequently than assault and robbery due to their more severe consequences. Consequently, there are instances in which the shooting and homicide rates equal zero for certain years, indicating no reported shootings in the "University" area from 2014 to 2016, for example. These zero inputs create erratic line graphs with varying amplitudes, making it challenging to discern clear patterns. Nonetheless, some noteworthy observations can be made when comparing the three different areas and considering the overall trend from 2014 to the present.

In Figure 3, it is evident that when shootings do occur, the shooting rate in the "University" area is considerably higher than in the residential areas. The most recent shooting incident in the "University" area was recorded in 2021. Conversely, shootings in the residential areas happen more frequently than on the UTSG campus, albeit with lower shooting rates.

In Figure 4, the fluctuations are more random compared to Figure 3. This unpredictability can be attributed to the inherent difficulty in preventing homicides, as they tend to occur randomly. Unlike other crimes that can potentially be deterred through regulations on firearms or increased police presence, homicides are less amenable to prevention measures. Nevertheless, based on Figure 4, it is evident that over the past four years, "Church-Wellesley" area experienced only a minimal number of homicides, whereas both the "University" and "Bay-Cloverhill" areas recorded zero homicides.

Same for this: For the assault rate, the "University" area is experiencing an increment of assaults after the sudden drop in the pandemic, but the assault rate has not surpassed 1750, where the assault rate is much above 1750 from 2014 to 2018. The assault rate in the other two residential areas is more stabilized, where the "Church-Wellesley" area's assault rate oscillates around 1500, and the "Bay-Cloverhill" area's assault rate oscillates around 750. Therefore, there are no clear shreds of evidence pointing to the increment of assault near the UTSG campus in recent years. 

For the robbery rate, a constant decrease can be witnessed in the robbery rate in the "University" area starting in 2014, where the robbery rate is around 700. Recently, the robbery rate has been stable at around 150 in the "University" area. The residential areas have constant robbery rate since 2014, where "Church-Wellesley" area's robbery rate oscillates around 250, and "Bay-Cloverhill" area's robbery rate oscillates around 150. It is evident that there has not been a severe increase in robbery in recent years. 

For the shooting rate, the graph varies in different amplitude. Both "University" and "Bay-Cloverhill" areas stay the same frequency and amounts of shooting as before. "Church-Wellesley" has a slight increment of shooting from 2022 to 2023, but it is the most remote area in this research from the UTSG campus, so the impact is minimized. 

For the homicide rate, the graph fluctuates a lot just like the shooting rate. Nonetheless, the homicide rate are extremely low in the past four years, contrasting the high homicide rate around 10 from 2014 to 2019. The "University" and "Bay-Cloverhill" areas even maintain zero homicide rates after 2020. Clearly, homicide rates have not increased in recent years. 

From above, minimum evidence can prove that the crime rate near the UTSG campus has been increasing at a drastic rate. Conversely, some crime rates are even undergoing a downsizing near the three selected areas. Thus, the belief that studying on campus at UTSG is becoming more dangerous than before cannot be backed up by enough evidence. The study environment of the UTSG campus has not witnessed an increase in hazard, some data even demonstrates that it is transforming into a comparatively safer state.

Regarding the assault rate, the "University" area has seen an increase in assaults following the sudden drop during the pandemic. However, it's noteworthy that the assault rate has not exceeded 1750, which is significantly lower than the assault rate observed from 2014 to 2018. In contrast, the assault rates in the other two residential areas remain relatively stable. Specifically, the assault rate in the "Church-Wellesley" area oscillates around 1500, while in the "Bay-Cloverhill" area, it fluctuates around 750. Consequently, there is no substantial evidence suggesting a significant increase in assaults near the UTSG campus in recent years.

Turning to the robbery rate, there has been a consistent decrease in the "University" area since 2014, when the robbery rate was approximately 700. Recently, the robbery rate in the "University" area has stabilized at around 150. In the residential areas, the robbery rates have remained steady since 2014. Specifically, the "Church-Wellesley" area's robbery rate fluctuates around 250, while the "Bay-Cloverhill" area's robbery rate hovers around 150. These observations indicate that there has not been a notable increase in robberies in recent years.

In the case of the shooting rate, the graph exhibits variations in different amplitudes. Both the "University" and "Bay-Cloverhill" areas have maintained a consistent frequency and quantity of shootings. While the "Church-Wellesley" area has experienced a slight increase in shootings from 2022 to 2023, it is crucial to note that this area is the furthest from the UTSG campus in this study, minimizing its impact.

Similarly, for the homicide rate, the graph displays fluctuations similar to the shooting rate. However, the homicide rates have remained extremely low over the past four years, contrasting with the higher homicide rates around 10 from 2014 to 2019. Notably, both the "University" and "Bay-Cloverhill" areas have maintained zero homicide rates after 2020. These trends indicate that homicide rates have not increased in recent years.

In summary, the available evidence does not strongly support the notion that the crime rate near the UTSG campus has been experiencing a significant increase. In fact, some crime rates are even showing a decrease in the selected areas. Therefore, the belief that studying on the UTSG campus is becoming more dangerous than before lacks substantial evidence. The study environment on the UTSG campus does not appear to have witnessed a significant increase in hazards; some data even suggests it is becoming comparatively safer.
